## üöÄ Project Overview

This animated login page features a sleek, modern design with captivating visual effects that will impress both users and employers. The project showcases:

- **Eye-catching animated borders** with gradient effects
- **Smooth input field transitions** for enhanced user experience
- **Clean, minimalist design** with perfect alignment and spacing
- **Responsive layout** that works on various screen sizes

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic CSS Animations**: Rotating gradient borders create a visually striking effect
- **Interactive Form Elements**:
  - Floating labels that animate when focused
  - Underline effects that expand into full backgrounds
  - Smooth transitions for all interactive elements
